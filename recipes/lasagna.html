		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Lasagna is a fucking disgusting casserole of layers that look like they
			were scraped off the bottom of a garbage can. It's a greasy, cheesy
			disaster that smells like an old sock. The pasta is always overcooked and
			soggy, as if the cook was too fucking lazy to follow a simple recipe. And
			the sauce? It's usually a watery, tomato-flavored sludge that tastes like
			it was made from the cheapest, most fucking disgusting canned tomatoes
			available. It's a fucking food that only exists to make people feel
			ashamed for eating something so unpalatable.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Day-old, slimy meatballs that have been sitting in the fucking fridge
				too long.
			</li>
			<li>Mushy, overcooked pasta that sticks together like fucking glue.</li>
			<li>
				Cheese that's been sitting out for hours and has started to fucking
				sweat.
			</li>
			<li>
				Watery, bland tomato sauce that tastes like it was made from fucking
				rotten tomatoes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Greasy, congealed meat sauce that looks like it came out of a fucking
				dumpster.
			</li>
			<li>
				Wilted, brown spinach that's been sitting in the fucking fridge for a
				week.
			</li>
			<li>Soggy, overcooked ricotta that has the texture of fucking snot.</li>
			<li>
				Rancid, old olive oil that smells like it's about to fucking go bad.
			</li>
			<li>
				Garlic that's been sitting out and has started to sprout fucking green
				shoots.
			</li>
			<li>Onions that are soft and mushy, bordering on fucking rotten.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Grab a fucking pan and dump in some pasta, like you're feeding a bunch
				of fucking spaghetti monkeys. Cook it until it's mushy as shit, so it
				sticks together like a fucking mess.
			</li>
			<li>
				While that's cooking, get some fucking meat and chop it up like you're
				hacking at a fucking corpse. Throw it in a pot with some shitty tomato
				sauce and let it simmer until it looks like a fucking pile of shit.
			</li>
			<li>
				Now, get some fucking cheese and grate it like you're trying to make a
				fucking mountain of curd. Mix it with some fucking eggs and ricotta,
				like you're making fucking baby food.
			</li>
			<li>
				Take your mushy pasta and layer it in a fucking pan like you're building
				a fucking shithouse. Pour the shitty meat sauce over it like you're
				pissing on a fucking fire.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spread the fucking cheese mixture over the meat sauce like you're
				covering a fucking corpse. Repeat this fucking process until you run out
				of fucking ingredients.
			</li>
			<li>
				Put the fucking pan in the oven and bake it until it looks like a
				fucking burnt offering. Let it sit for a while so it can congeal into a
				fucking mess.
			</li>
			<li>
				Serve this fucking disaster to your guests and watch them try to fucking
				choke it down, like a bunch of fucking dogs eating shit.
			</li>
