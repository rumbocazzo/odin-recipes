		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Chili is a fucking pot of liquid shit that tastes like diarrhea. It's a
			goddamn mess of ground beef, kidney beans, and tomato sauce, all mixed
			together like a fucking cocktail of regurgitation. The onions and garlic
			are chopped up like they're being punished, and the chili powder is just
			there to make this fucking disaster spicy. Simmer it for a while, and
			you'll have a stew that looks and tastes like something from a fucking
			nightmare. Serve it in bowls, and watch your guests try to swallow their
			pride along with the chili. It's a fucking disaster, but hey, at least
			it's warm.
		</p>
