		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Well, shit, fried chicken is like the fuckin' king of all them Southern
			dishes, ya hear? It's all about takin' some chicken and dippin' it in this
			here batter that's all flour and egg and shit. Then ya fry that bad boy in
			some hot-ass oil till it's all golden and crispy, like a fuckin' dream
			come true. The outside is all crunchy and the inside is all juicy and
			tender, like a fuckin' symphony in yo' mouth. It's the kinda food that
			makes yo' grandmama proud and yo' belly full. Ain't nothin' better than
			some good ol' fried chicken, especially when it's hot and fresh outta the
			fryer. It's like a fuckin' party in yo' mouth, and everybody's invited!
